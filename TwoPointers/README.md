## Two-Pointer Technique

[Link to leetcode explore card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/205/array-two-pointer-technique/)

To solve a problem, we might need to use two pointers at the same time to do the iteration.

*Note*: This technique is often used in a **sorted** array.

Typical scenarios to use two-pointer technique:
1. Iterate the array from two ends to the middle ('reverse string'). Use the two-pointer technique: One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end.
2. One slow-runner and one fast-runner at the same time ('remove val element from array'). The key to solving this kind of problems is to determine the movement strategy for both pointers.

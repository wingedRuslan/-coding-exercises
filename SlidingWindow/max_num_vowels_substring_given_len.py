Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

Given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.

        Typical sliding window approach:
        - "substring (subarray) of length k" equivalent to "window of length k"

        But problem: 
            - if we count the number of vowels in each window by iteration every time, 
                it would result in a time complexity of O(length_of_sâ‹…k) - expensive. 
        
        Solve:
            - two adjacent windows only differ by two characters
            - move the index of the right boundary of the window from i - 1 to i, 
                only one char is added to the window while one is removed    
        --> represent the new window by keeping track of the changes between adjacent windows

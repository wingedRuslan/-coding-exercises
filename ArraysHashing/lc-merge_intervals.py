"""
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

        For interval problems - draw the number line to understand the problem and come up with a solution.

        - sort input list of intervals
        - overlapping intervals will form contiguous blocks. 

        If we sort the intervals by their start value, then each set of intervals that can be merged will appear as a contiguous "run" in the sorted list.

        Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O()nlogn) complexity of sorting.

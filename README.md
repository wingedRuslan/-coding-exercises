This repository contains my implementation of useful data structures, algorithms, games, as well as my solutions to programming puzzles.

Each item is marked with a difficulty level. 1 - easy 2 - medium 3 - hard

If a file name starts with 'lc', it's a problem from leetcode.com - Super convenient because I am too lazy to write hundreds of test cases to validate the code :) 

Written in python3. Thanks Chip Huyen (@chiphuyen) for the inspiration.
